// These live outside tests/vectors/*.json because the JSON vectors can
// only feed *text* through the engine, and every regex/dictionary
// detection is hardcoded to score 1.0 (engine.js). The bugs covered
// here only appear once detections carry *differing* scores, which
// happens the moment the ML detector is enabled (onnx-detector.js
// forwards the model softmax, always < 1.0).
